# Google Cybersecurity Projects

This repository contains a series of hands-on security documentation projects and technical exercises completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** program. Each file demonstrates applied skills in areas like risk assessment, incident response, SQL filtering, Linux security, and automation using Python.

Each project is done through **Background Case Scenario** provided by the course itself.
